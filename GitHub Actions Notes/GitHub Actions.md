# GitHub Actions Overview

**GitHub Actions** is a feature of GitHub that automates various tasks within your software development workflow. It helps you set up processes that run automatically when specific events occur in your GitHub repository.

## Why .github/workflows/ is Mandatory
**Standard Location**:

- **GitHub Actions Requirement**: GitHub expects all workflow files to be stored in a specific directory structure within your repository. The standard directory is .github/workflows/.
- **Purpose**: This convention ensures that GitHub Actions can find and execute the workflow files automatically.
##
**Automatic Detection**:

- **How It Works**: GitHub Actions scans the .github/workflows/ directory for YAML files that define workflows. Workflows are then triggered based on events such as pushes or pull requests.
- **Example Path**: If you have a file named main.yml in the .github/workflows/ directory, GitHub will recognize it as a workflow file.

## GitHub Actions for CI/CD

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool for automating Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) processes in your projects. Here’s how it enhances your CI/CD pipeline:

### What It Solves in CI/CD

1. **Automates Testing (Continuous Integration):**
   - **Problem:** Manually testing code changes each time they are made can be slow and error-prone.
   - **Solution:** GitHub Actions automatically runs tests on your code every time you push changes to your repository. This ensures code quality is maintained and issues are identified early.

2. **Streamlines Builds (Continuous Integration):**
   - **Problem:** Building and compiling code manually for every change is cumbersome and can lead to inconsistencies.
   - **Solution:** GitHub Actions automatically builds your code every time changes are pushed, ensuring that your code remains in a buildable state and reducing manual effort.

3. **Automates Deployment (Continuous Deployment):**
   - **Problem:** Manually deploying code changes to production environments can be risky and time-consuming.
   - **Solution:** GitHub Actions can automatically deploy your code to production or staging environments once tests pass, minimizing human error and accelerating the release process.

4. **Custom Workflow Management:**
   - **Problem:** Different projects have unique CI/CD requirements that can be complex to configure manually.
   - **Solution:** GitHub Actions allows you to define custom workflows with steps tailored to your project’s needs, from running tests and building code to deploying applications.

## In Summary

GitHub Actions integrates seamlessly with GitHub to provide automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It helps by automatically testing, building, and deploying your code, making your CI/CD processes more efficient and reliable.

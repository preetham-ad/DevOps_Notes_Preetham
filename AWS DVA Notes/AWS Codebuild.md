# AWS CodeBuild Overview

## What is AWS CodeBuild?
- **Official Definition**: AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready for deployment. It scales automatically to meet your build needs, so you don't have to manage any infrastructure.
- **Simplified Definition**: AWS CodeBuild is a service that automatically builds and tests your code, creating the final software packages you need for deployment. It manages all the computing resources for you.

## Key Features
- **Fully Managed**: AWS CodeBuild handles the infrastructure and management of build servers, so you don’t need to worry about setting up or maintaining build environments.
- **Scalable**: Automatically scales to handle any number of builds concurrently, ensuring fast and efficient builds.
- **Custom Build Environments**: Allows you to define custom build environments using Docker images.
- **Integrated with AWS Services**: Works seamlessly with other AWS services like AWS CodePipeline, Amazon S3, and AWS Lambda for a complete CI/CD workflow.
- **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing**: You only pay for the build time you use, with no upfront costs or long-term commitments.

## Build Environments
- **Definition**: A build environment is a pre-configured setup that includes all the necessary tools and dependencies required to build and test your software.
- **Simplified Definition**: A build environment is like a special workspace where your code gets compiled and tested. It has all the tools and settings needed for this process.

### Pre-Packaged Build Environments
- **Official Definition**: AWS CodeBuild provides pre-packaged build environments in the form of Docker images. These images contain commonly used build tools and libraries, so you don’t have to configure them manually.
- **Simplified Definition**: AWS CodeBuild offers ready-to-use Docker images that come with popular build tools and libraries already set up. This saves you from having to manually install and configure these tools.

## Problems Solved
- **Infrastructure Management**: Eliminates the need to set up and manage your own build servers and infrastructure.
- **Build Scalability**: Automatically handles scaling to meet the demand for multiple concurrent builds.
- **Pre-Packaged Tools**: Provides ready-made environments with essential build tools, reducing setup time and effort.

## Why It's Used
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the process of setting up and running builds without managing servers.
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduces costs by providing a pay-as-you-go model for build resources.
- **Speed**: Speeds up the build process with automatic scaling and integration with other AWS services.
- **Convenience**: Offers pre-configured environments, so you can start building without spending time on setup.

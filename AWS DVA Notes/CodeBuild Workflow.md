# AWS CodeBuild Overview

## CodeBuild Workflow

### Official Documentation Overview

1. **Source Stage:**
   - CodeBuild retrieves the source code from a repository such as GitHub, CodeCommit, or S3.

2. **Build Execution:**
   - CodeBuild uses the instructions specified in the `buildspec.yml` file to perform the build process, which includes compiling code, running tests, and packaging artifacts.

3. **Artifacts and Logs:**
   - After the build process, CodeBuild stores the build artifacts (the results of the build) and logs for review.

## CodeBuild Project

### Official Documentation Overview

A CodeBuild project defines the build environment and build settings. It includes:

1. **Source Repository:**
   - The location where the source code is stored.

2. **Environment:**
   - The build environment settings, such as the operating system and runtime.

3. **Buildspec:**
   - The `buildspec.yml` file or inline build commands that define the build process.

4. **Artifacts:**
   - The destination where the build results are stored.

### Simplified Explanation

- Think of a CodeBuild project as a detailed setup plan for building your code. It specifies:
  - Where to get your code from.
  - What kind of environment to use for the build.
  - What to do with the results after the build is finished.

## `buildspec.yml` File

### Official Documentation Overview

The `buildspec.yml` file is used by CodeBuild to define the build process. It is included as part of your source code repository and provides instructions for building and testing your application.

**Key Sections of `buildspec.yml`:**

1. **version:**
   - Specifies the version of the build specification.

2. **phases:**
   - Defines the stages of the build, such as `install`, `pre_build`, `build`, and `post_build`.

3. **artifacts:**
   - Specifies the files or directories to be saved after the build.

4. **cache:**
   - Optional caching to speed up future builds.

### Simplified Explanation

- The `buildspec.yml` file acts as a detailed instruction manual for CodeBuild. It:
  - Lives in the root folder of your project.
  - Details the steps to build and test your code.
  - Specifies what to do with the final product.
  - Includes instructions on how to make the build process faster by caching files.

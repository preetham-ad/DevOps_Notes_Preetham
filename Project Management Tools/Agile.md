# What is Agile?

Agile is a project management methodology that breaks projects into smaller phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement. Rather than sticking to a rigid, upfront plan, Agile allows teams to remain flexible and make adjustments as needed throughout the project.

## Key Concepts

### Iterative Development
- **Definition**: Work is divided into small, manageable segments called iterations or sprints.
- **Example**: Instead of developing an entire app at once, you build it in stages, adding new features incrementally every few weeks.

### Continuous Feedback
- **Definition**: Regularly obtaining input from customers or stakeholders to ensure the product meets their needs.
- **Example**: Presenting a prototype of the app to users after each sprint and making improvements based on their feedback.

### Collaboration
- **Definition**: Team members work closely together and maintain frequent communication.
- **Example**: Daily stand-up meetings where team members discuss what they accomplished yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any challenges they are facing.

### Flexibility
- **Definition**: Being open to changes in requirements or direction as the project progresses.
- **Example**: If a client requests a new feature during development, the team can adjust their plans to incorporate it.

## Key Components of Agile

### Sprints
- **Definition**: Short, fixed periods (usually 1-4 weeks) during which a specific set of work is completed.
- **Example**: A sprint might focus on developing the login feature of an app.

### Backlog
- **Definition**: A list of all tasks or features that need to be completed.
- **Example**: The backlog might include tasks such as “Create user profile page” and “Implement search function.”

### Scrum
- **Definition**: A popular Agile framework that includes roles, ceremonies, and artifacts to manage the process.
- **Example**: Scrum features roles like the Scrum Master (who helps the team adhere to Agile practices) and ceremonies like sprint planning meetings.

### Kanban
- **Definition**: An Agile approach that visualizes work and workflow to enhance efficiency.
- **Example**: Using a Kanban board to monitor tasks as they progress through stages like “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.”

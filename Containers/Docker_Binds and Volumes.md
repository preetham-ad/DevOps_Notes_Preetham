# Docker Binds and Volumes

Docker provides two main methods to handle data in containers: bind mounts and volumes. Hereâ€™s a straightforward explanation of each:

## 1. Docker Binds (Bind Mounts)

### Simple Definition

- **Bind Mounts**: These let you link a specific folder or file on your computer (host) directly to a folder or file inside a Docker container. Any changes you make to the files on your computer are immediately visible inside the container and vice versa.

### What It Solves

- **Access to Host Files**: Allows the container to use files from your computer. Perfect for development when you want to quickly test changes without rebuilding the container.
- **Development Convenience**: You can edit files on your computer, and the container will reflect these changes in real time.

### Example

```bash
docker run -v /my/local/folder:/container/folder myapp
```
This command connects /my/local/folder on your computer to /container/folder inside the container. Changes in one location appear in the other.

## 2. Docker Volumes
### Simple Definition
- Volumes: These are storage areas managed by Docker. They exist independently of any container and can be used by multiple containers. Volumes keep their data even if you stop or remove the container.
### What It Solves
- Data Persistence: Volumes ensure that data remains safe and accessible even if the container is stopped or removed. This is crucial for storing things like database information.
- Sharing Data: Volumes can be shared between different containers. This is useful for scenarios where multiple containers need to access the same data or configuration files.

## How to Create and Attach Volumes
Create a Volume:
```bash
docker volume create myvolume
```
This creates a new volume named myvolume.

Attach a Volume to a Container:
```bash
docker run -v myvolume:/container/folder myapp
```
This command attaches the myvolume volume to /container/folder in the container. Data stored in this folder is saved in myvolume.

## Benefits of Using Volumes
Data Reliability: Your data stays intact even if the container is deleted or replaced.
Ease of Backup and Restore: Volumes can be backed up and restored independently from the container.
Multiple Container Access: Easily share data between multiple containers using the same volume.

## Deleting a Docker Volume

- 1.**Stop and Remove Containers**:

Before you can delete a Docker volume, you need to ensure that no container is using it. Docker does not allow you to delete a volume that is currently in use by a container. This means you need to stop and remove any containers that are using the volume.

- Stopping a Container:
```bash
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
```
- Removing a Container:
```bash
docker rm <container_id_or_name>
```
This removes the container from Docker, but does not delete the volume.

- 2.**Deleting the Volume**:

Once the container is stopped and removed, you can safely delete the volume.

List Volumes:
```bash
docker volume ls
```

Remove a Volume:
```bash
docker volume rm <volume_name>
```

## Using External Storage with Docker Volumes
Docker volumes can also be used with external storage solutions like AWS EC2 or S3, or other cloud storage services.

# Distroless Docker Images: A Simplified Overview

## What Are Distroless Docker Images?

**Distroless Docker images** are special types of Docker images designed to be as minimal as possible. Unlike traditional Docker images that include a full operating system and various packages, distroless images include only the essential components needed to run your application. This typically means they do not have a package manager, shell, or other unnecessary utilities.

## Why Use Distroless Images?

### Minimal Size

- **Smaller Images**: Distroless images are much smaller because they exclude everything except what’s necessary to run your application. This can lead to faster download times and less storage use.

### Simplified Environment

- **Less Overhead**: By including only the runtime environment, distroless images have fewer layers and dependencies. This reduces complexity and can make the images easier to manage.

### Increased Security

- **Fewer Vulnerabilities**: With fewer components and tools, there are fewer potential security vulnerabilities. There are no package managers or shells that could be exploited by attackers.
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: Less software means fewer potential points of entry for attackers.

## How Does Distroless Work with Golang Apps?

For applications built with Go (Golang), a distroless image is a great fit because Go applications are statically linked. This means that all necessary libraries and dependencies are included in the compiled binary itself. Thus, the runtime environment doesn’t need to include extra libraries or tools beyond what’s needed to execute the Go binary.
